# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\n2'
#
# Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.
#
# Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only
# 1s. 
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is
# underlined.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation:
# [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is
# underlined.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 1 <= A.length <= 20000
# 0 <= K <= A.length
# A[i] is 0 or 1 
#
#
#
#
#
# @param {Integer[]} a
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
