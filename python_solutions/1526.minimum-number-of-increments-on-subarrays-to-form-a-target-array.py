#
# Given an array of positive integers target and an array initial of same size
# with all zeros.
#
# Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from initial
# if you are allowed to do the following operation:
#
#
# Choose any subarray from initial and increment each value by one.
#
# The answer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
# integer.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: target = [1,2,3,2,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We need at least 3 operations to form the target array from the
# initial array.
# [0,0,0,0,0] increment 1 from index 0 to 4 (inclusive).
# [1,1,1,1,1] increment 1 from index 1 to 3 (inclusive).
# [1,2,2,2,1] increment 1 at index 2.
# [1,2,3,2,1] target array is formed.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: target = [3,1,1,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1] -> [1,1,1,2] -> [2,1,1,2] ->
# [3,1,1,2] (target).
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: target = [3,1,5,4,2]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1] -> [2,1,1,1,1] ->
# [3,1,1,1,1]
# ⁠                                 -> [3,1,2,2,2] -> [3,1,3,3,2] ->
# [3,1,4,4,2] -> [3,1,5,4,2] (target).
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: target = [1,1,1,1]
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= target.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= target[i] <= 10^5
#
#
